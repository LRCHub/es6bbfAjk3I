[00:04.14] Oh, make me over
[00:07.68] I'm all I wanna be
[00:11.25] A walking study
[00:14.84] In demonology
[00:21.34] 
[00:16.40] Hey, so glad you could make it
[00:19.89] Yeah, now you really made it
[00:23.52] Hey, so glad you could make it now
[00:40.52] 
[00:32.68] Oh, look at my face
[00:36.15] My name is might have been
[00:39.62] My name is never was
[00:43.11] My name's forgotten
[00:52.61] 
[00:44.82] Hey, so glad you could make it
[00:48.59] Yeah, now you really made it
[00:51.97] Hey, there's only us left now
[01:06.47] 
[00:59.45] When I wake up in my makeup
[01:03.04] It's too early for that dress
[01:06.61] Wilted and faded
[01:08.55] Somewhere in Hollywood
[01:10.30] I'm glad I came here with your pound of flesh
[01:32.80] 
[01:13.99] No second billing 'cause you're a star now
[01:17.56] Oh, Cinderella, they aren't sluts like you
[01:21.28] Beautiful garbage, beautiful dresses
[01:24.74] Can you stand up or will you just fall down?
[01:46.74] 
[01:29.98] You better watch out
[01:33.62] For what you wish for
[01:37.15] It better be worth it
[01:40.66] So much to die for
[01:49.66] 
[01:42.31] Hey, so glad you could make it
[01:45.75] Yeah, now you really made it
[01:49.25] Hey, there's only us left now
[02:03.75] 
[01:56.73] When I wake up in my makeup
[02:00.38] Have you ever felt so used up as this?
[02:03.84] It's all so sugarless
[02:05.79] Hooker, waitress, model, actress
[02:09.02] Oh, just go nameless
[02:19.02] 
[02:11.24] Honeysuckle, she's full of poison
[02:14.58] She obliterated everything she kissed
[02:18.46] Now she's fading somewhere in Hollywood
[02:21.73] I'm glad I came here with your pound of flesh
[02:44.23] 
[02:27.13] You want a part of me
[02:30.58] Well, I'm not selling cheap
[02:34.05] No, I'm not selling cheap
